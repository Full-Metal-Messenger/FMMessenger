How it works

Sign Up or Sign In

Pick a chat room and begin sending chatting.

If you accidently post a message before it is complete you can delete it and repost if you like.

You can create your own chat rooms and invite your friends to your room.

If you no longer like your user name, you can edit and make a new one.
